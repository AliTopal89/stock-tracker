# Create a Stock Portfolio Tracker

## Object-Oriented Javascript

Using the `seeds.json` file to supply data, create a webpage for managing a stock portfolio. To start, we'll use the mock data provided in the `seeds.json` file.

Include Javascript that describes the two objects below, as well as the associated methods. You can add methods and properties as necessary!

- `interface`
  - `lookup`: Search `seeds.json` for a user-input stock symbol and retrieve its data
- `stock`
  - `display`: Display the information about the given stock
  - `calculate`: Calculate the total value of a user-input number of shares in this stock
- `portfolio`
  - `display`: Display the information about all stocks included in the `seeds.json` file 
  - `calculate`: Calculate the total value of all stocks for which the user has input a number of shares
